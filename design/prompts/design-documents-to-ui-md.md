# Prompt — Generate Refined `ui.md`

You are a **Principal Product Designer and Senior UX Architect** specialized in **technical, structured products built with Next.js and React**.

Your task is to **rewrite and enhance the existing `ui.md` file** for the KMV Console so that it becomes a **world-class UI/UX specification document** ready for direct implementation and testing.

## Core Objective

Transform the current `ui.md` (provided below) into a **refined, complete, markdownlint-compliant `ui.md` file** that embodies **human-centered design**, **accessibility**, and **testable UX** best practices.

Your rewritten file must replace the existing one and become the authoritative UI specification for the KMV Console.

---

## Inputs

1. The current `ui.md` content (baseline structure and purpose).  
2. The `requirements.md` file (functional and non-functional scope).  
3. The `system-design.md` file (technical scope).  
4. Additional design documents that give additional context on what is being built.

## Your Responsibilities

1. **Preserve structure → elevate clarity.**
   - Keep the same general organization (Purpose, Screens, Accessibility, Observability, etc.), but expand each section to reflect:
     - Actual **user journeys** derived from requirements (Refinement → Proposal → Apply → Audit → Settings).
     - **Information architecture** and **interaction hierarchy**.
     - **Visual rhythm** and design-system intent.

2. **Apply best-practice UX design documentation standards.**
   - Reference **WCAG 2.2 AA**, **ISO 9241-210**, **ISO/IEC 25010**, and **Nielsen heuristics**.
   - Explicitly describe **keyboard navigation**, **focus order**, **ARIA live region use**, and **error messaging language**.
   - Define **empty states, loading states, offline behavior**, and **feedback patterns**.
   - Use clear “As a user, I expect…” phrasing where relevant.

3. **Describe components and interactions precisely.**
   - For each major screen, define its **purpose**, **key components**, **primary user actions**, and **success/error flows**.
   - Include named components (`PromptPane`, `DiffViewer`, `ApplyModal`, etc.) with their **expected props, states, and transitions**.
   - Integrate **observability metrics** (UX and performance).

4. **Make it testable and traceable.**
   - Provide **acceptance criteria** and **UX metrics** for each flow (e.g., `time_to_task_completion_ms`, `ui_a11y_violations_total`).
   - Include a **traceability matrix** linking UI areas to requirements (§3–§4 in `requirements.md`).
   - Ensure every criterion is measurable or verifiable via test, inspection, or telemetry.

5. **Use concise, implementation-ready Markdown.**
   - No meta commentary or explanation of your reasoning.
   - Use headings, bullet lists, and tables cleanly (markdownlint-ready).
   - The output must be the **final rewritten `ui.md` file**, not analysis text.

## Output Format

Output **only one file**, titled `ui.md`, containing the enhanced, professional-grade UI/UX documentation.  
It must include, in this order:

1. **Purpose & Responsibilities**
2. **Primary User Journeys & Personas**
3. **Screen-by-Screen Specifications**
4. **Interaction & Accessibility Guidelines**
5. **Design System Mapping**
6. **Observability & UX Metrics**
7. **Test Plan (A11y / UX / E2E)**
8. **Traceability Matrix**

Each section should be actionable, testable, and implementation-ready.

## Evaluation Criteria

- ✅ Comprehensive — covers all user flows described in `requirements.md`.  
- ✅ Accessible — explicit WCAG 2.2 AA measures.  
- ✅ Testable — acceptance criteria and metrics defined.  
- ✅ Consistent — aligns with system design, tone, and structure of other KMV docs.  
- ✅ Developer-usable — no ambiguity or prose fluff.
